<!-- 
    OBJECTIVE 
create a to-do list application using NextJS
- add functionality to track progress over time
- will help answer questions such as:
    1. how many tasks have you finished over a period of time?
    2. what is your most productive day of the week?
    3. how many minutes/hours/days do you need to complete a task on average?

    INFO
lang = Node
frmwrk = NextJS
    app should persist data in a database
- postgres = database
- sequelize = ORM
        create a to-do model
each to-do should have . . .
    - a unique id
    - name
    - created_at
    - completed_at
    - status
fields

use React Bootstrap and React Hook Forms
    create a page that shows:
        - a list of the user's to-dos with a checkbox to mark the task complete
        - a delete button that deletes a task
        - a simple form to add new tasks (react hook forms should be used here)
    create a simple "analytics" page that shows the number of the to-dos created and the number of the to-dos completed in a specific time frame (default = last 7 days)

    using query parameters, the page should accept two date ranges and filter the to-dos accordingly.
